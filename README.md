# This program simulates a basic Email System with the following features:

1.User login: The user is prompted to enter their email and password. The program checks if the entered credentials match any of the predefined email and password pairs.

2.User menu: After successful login, the user is presented with a menu to choose from the following options:

- Compose a new email
- View inbox
- View sent emails
- Logout

3.Compose a new email: The user can enter the recipient email, subject, and message to send a new email. The program simply displays a success message and the entered details.

4.View inbox: The user can view the inbox, but since this is a simplified system, it displays a message indicating that there are no new messages.

5.View sent emails: Similar to the inbox, the user can view the sent emails, and the program displays a message indicating that there are no sent emails.

6.Logout: The user can choose to logout from the system.

Please note that this is a simplified version of an Email System and does not include features like email storage, advanced search, or actual email sending functionality.

It serves as a basic simulation of an email system in Java.
